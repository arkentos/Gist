# Introduction

The [book](http://www.fullstack.io/edu/angular/rails/).

The author [Ari Lerner](https://github.com/auser) is a Founder of [FullStack](http://www.fullstack.io/). He also authored/co-authored:

- [ng-book: The Complete Book on AngularJS](https://www.ng-book.com/)

- [ng-newsletter.com](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/)

Prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of AngularJS
- Basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails

Organization:

- You will first set up a Rails application with authentication and authorization
- You will then walk through two approaches:
    - Build the Rails application in the traditional way
    - Build the Rails app as a back-end RESTful API and focus on building the AngularJS front end independently

Additional resources:

- [AngularJS docs](http://docs.angularjs.org/)
- [thinkster.io](http://www.thinkster.io/)

## Development environment

We'll be working in two different environments in the book:

1. The Rails environment
2. The AngularJS environment

Suggested editor: [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3). I use [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2).

Suggested browser: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)

To run the tests, we'll need the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.10/index.html) library and [nodejs](http://nodejs.org).

For version control, non other than [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is suggested.

Steps:

- Install NodeJS
- Install Karma

```
$ npm install -g karma
```

- Install Ruby
- Install Rails

```
$ gem install rails
```
