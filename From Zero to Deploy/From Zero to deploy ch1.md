What makes Rails so great?

- It is 100% open source
- It is available under the permissive [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)
- It costs nothing to download or use
- It has an elegant and compact design
- It is built on the [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) language
- It creates a [domain-specific language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Specific_Language) for writing web applications
- The resulting application code is concise and readable
- Rails adapts rapidly to new developments in web technology and framework design. For example, Rails was one of the first frameworks to fully digest and implement the REST architectural style for structuring web applications
- When other frameworks develop successful new techniques, Rails creator [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://loudthinking.com/) and the [Rails core team](http://rubyonrails.org/core) donâ€™t hesitate to incorporate their ideas
- Rails benefits from an unusually enthusiastic and diverse community. The results include:
    - hundreds of open-source [contributors](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/)
    - well-attended [conferences](http://railsconf.com/)
    - a huge number of [gems](https://rubygems.org/)
    - a rich variety of informative blogs
    - a cornucopia of discussion forums and IRC channels
- The large number of Rails programmers also makes it easier to handle the inevitable application errors: the "Google the error message" algorithm nearly always produces a relevant blog post or discussion-forum thread
