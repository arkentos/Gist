# On Writing

Write consistently. Make consistent progress every day. A decent length for an eBook is 25,000 words. At 1,000 words a day (2 or 3 pages) for 30 days you would have 30,000 words. Do some editing and cut down your content (which is necessary), and you have a book written in 30 days.

**Why write?**

- It is a great way to teach people.
- Teaching and sharing expands your reach and influence.
- People remember and respect those who have taught them.
- To be known you must teach.

**IMPORTANT:** *If you know a skill that other people use to make money, you can make a living by teaching that skill.*

**Finding a topic**

A good place to start is by writing about an area in which other people perceive you to be an expert.

- You don't have to be an expert to teach.
- Get in the habit of sharing everything you know.

**Establishing expertise**

If you want to make a living from your teaching, you should be perceived as an expert. A few quotes from past clients combined with some in-depth blog posts or tutorials is enough to give you the credibility to write your book. Writing a book gets you half way there.

- Name your book.
- Set up a landing page.
- Start calling yourself the author of "xxxx".
- ... and people will take you a lot more seriously even before your book is published.

[Tim Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/about/) says that to become perceived as an expert:

- Join trade organizations with official-sounding names.
- Read and summarize the top three best-selling books on your topic.
- Write for other sites and magazines.
- Give a talk at a local university and local offices of large companies.
- Piggyback on other people for press.

**Finding a market**

Two factors define whether or not your book can be successful.

1. Does it teach a skill that other people use to make money?
2. Do those people gather and communicate online?

**TIP:** *An easy way to see if potential readers are searching for similar products online is with Google's keyword research tool.* [Google Keyword Tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool)

**Competition**

You should be concerned if there are no competitors. Competition shows that there is a market. Embrace competition.

**Writer's block**

> When faced with writerâ€™s block, lower your standards and keep going. ~ [Sandra Tsing Loh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Tsing_Loh)

Seth Godin claims he never gets writer's block. Why? Because he writes like he talks. And "No one ever gets talker's block."
