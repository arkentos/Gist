# The Basics of AngularJS

The official AngularJS introduction describes AngularJS as a:

> client-side technology, written entirely in JavaScript. It works with the long-established technologies of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to make the development of web apps easier and faster than ever before.

It is a framework that is primarily used to build single-page web applications.

AngularJS augments HTML to give it native Model-View-Controller (MVC) capabilities.

AngularJS is open-sourced under [The MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

to see the DNS server response.
