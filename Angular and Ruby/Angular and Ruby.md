**AngularJS**

- [x] Build custom directives. Basic controllers and templates are great, but anything beyond basic interactivity usually requires custom directives. The learning curve for custom directives can be challenging, so just take it one step at a time.
- [x] Inter-directive communication via controllers.
- [x] Become very familiar with scope usage, best practices, and pitfalls. Scope inheritance, and encapsulation are some of the areas where Angular can drive you insane, but this knowledge is essential in order to build large-scale, maintainable Angular apps.
- [x] Explore the differences between Services, Factories, and Providers.
- [ ] Become a testing expert. One thing that I like about the Angular community is that tests are expected and encouraged.
